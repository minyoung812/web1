  There were dreams and goals that i had in my mind from the day i dreamt of becoming an artist.<br>
  Although i had to go through many obstacles,<strong>i learned that i should always believe in <u>myself.</u></strong><br>
  Strong faith has been the motivation of energy that keeps me going.<br>
  As my effort for the dreams has made me become who i am today, i still continue to strive for higher goals with faith.<br><br></p>

  Just like my body's stretch marks were a parr of my growing pains.<br>
  We will move on endlessly while enduring the pain,under the belief of my growth and this world's growth.<br>
  Because the pain creates the room for take-off.<br>
  I thank you for the "stretch" that pushed me forward.<br>
  <strong> As always,I need you.</strong><br><br>
